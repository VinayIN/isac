In Germany, all persons who rent an accommodation, as well as all persons who will be residing in Germany for more than three months are obligated to register their address. Within two weeks after your arrival in Cottbus or Senftenberg, you and your family members must register your address at the City Administration Office (Stadtbüro).


To register, you will need:

1. Your confirmation by your landlord (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung)
2. Your passport
3. A German Bank Account (If not, Blocked Account Statement)

At the city office in Cottbus, you need to take a number from the machine in the waiting area and wait until your number is called. Unfortunately, on some days, you may have to wait up to two hours until your number is called. Please make sure you have enough time and schedule your visit accordingly. On the homepage of the City Administration Office in Cottbus, you can find information about the current wait times [Aktuelle Wartesituation](https://www.cottbus.de/verwaltung/gb_ii/buergerservice/stadtbuero/aktuelle_wartesituation.html).
