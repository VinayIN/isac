#### 3. Shared private accommodation
In case you decide to stay in private shared accommodation, you can look for one on Wg-gesucht.de. These are all mostly furnished and shared between 2-4 people, again with a common kitchen and bathroom, but private bedrooms. Generally the landlords ask to meet the tenants personally, so you should be here personally; but some of them agree to do a skype call. However, be careful and do not transfer any deposits to the Landlord before it is confirmed by someone here that the property is genuine.
